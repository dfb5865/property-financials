Development
-----------

From the root directory, run:

`$ npm install
$ npm start`

This will start a server listening on your port (defined in config.js).

`config.js` will be created for you automatically the first time you run `npm install`

As you edit your `.jsx` files, the [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) will automatically update your components inside the browser without refreshing the page. This means you get to keep your existing state of your components!
